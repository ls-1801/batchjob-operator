The structure of this thesis allows the reader to read it in any order.
To guide the reader through this thesis, the structure of this Thesis section will briefly explain which section contains which information.

The Background Chapter is supposed to give a brief overview of this thesis's underlying concepts. This chapter introduces Big Data Streaming Processing, the Cluster Resource Manager Kubernetes, and Scheduling.

Following the Background chapter, the thesis provides an overview of the approach taken to tackle the problem described in the Problem Description Section. The Approach Section focuses on more profound concepts of Kubernetes and the Scheduling Cycle of the Kubernetes Scheduler. It summarizes the Kubernetes Operator pattern, which is commonly used to extend Kubernetes.

Implementation details will be given inside the Implementation Chapter, where an architectural overview and interaction between individual components are explained. The Implementation section also emphasizes the design Process for the Interface, which is exposed to an External-Scheduler. A significant part of the implementation is the Operator, which will be discussed extensively. The Implementation chapter shows how the points made inside the Approach Chapter are were implemented in the end.

An Evaluation of the research and contribution done by this thesis will be presented inside the evaluation chapter. Here its functionality is demonstrated. This section will also outline some of the limitations.

Before concluding the thesis, a comparison between State of the Art Technology is made.
