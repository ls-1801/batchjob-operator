### TODO:
- Thesis starts by giving a brief background to Big Data Streaming Processing, Cluster Management Systems (Kubernetes), and Scheduling
- Discuss the Approach this thesis takes on tackling the Problem Description, by explaining how scheduling in Kubernetes works and what it takes to Extend Kubernetes (using the Operator Pattern)
- Implementation Details that a worth mentioning: 
   - An architectural Overview.
   - The Process of designing an Interface 
   - The Operator that is used to extend Kubernetes
   - Changes that had to be made to existing Algorithms (and their tests)
- How the work of thesis is evaluated, by testing it's functionality, comparing results from previous work and finally outlining its limitations
- Comparing the Work that was done to current State of the Art Technology like the Batch Scheduling Framework Volcano and comparing to Scheduling approaches that are not available on Kubernetes
- A final Conclusion, with a note on future work, that is missing from the current implementation or requires rethinking.
