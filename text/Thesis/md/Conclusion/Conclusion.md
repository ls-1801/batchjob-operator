Kubernetes extendible design, using the Operator pattern and extending the Kubernetes Scheduler, allows the External-Scheduler-Interface to offer a simplistic Interface to scheduling of Distributed Dataflow Application on a Kubernetes Cluster. Using the interface allows an external scheduler to control batch applications' location without a deeper understanding of Kubernetes. Research in scheduling algorithms can build on top of the interface by creating controlled test scenarios using Testbeds. Commonly tested batch jobs, which are already configured and prepared, can be shared among researchers. Previously existing scheduling Algorithms like Mary and Hugo [@thamsen2021mary] can now solely focus on implementing the Scheduling Algorithm and can be less concerned with configuring a cluster.

Although far from perfect, the prototype has been evaluated to run many scheduling cycles, for hours, consistently without failure. In its current state, it requires polishing regarding error reporting and gracefully handling of errors.
