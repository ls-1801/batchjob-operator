The Approach section gives a more profound overview of core concepts of Kubernetes, which intern are the building blocks of the work done in this thesis. Starting with the Operator Pattern, which is strongly connected with the method, Kubernetes achieves its cluster orchestration, the *control loop*. The second section details how scheduling works in Kubernetes and how it can be manipulated to be controlled by an External-Scheduler using the Interface.
