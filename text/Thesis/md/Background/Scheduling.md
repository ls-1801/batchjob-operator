### TODO:
- Explain what Scheduling is
- Different kind of scheduling
    - DAG Scheduling done by Spark (Not what this thesis is about)
    - POD Scheduling done by the Cluster Resource Manager
        - Co-Location
        - Packing
- Explain why Scheduling is Important
    - Co-Location Problem
    - Low Resource Usage (Graph from Google)
    - Results from Hugo/Mary Paper


### Open:
- Should maybe start a bit less specific about this Thesis and find more Information about Scheduling in general or is it fine if the Background section starts of general and tailors towards the topic of my thesis?
